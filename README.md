# React Router Practice with JSON Server

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run JSON Server**

   ```bash
   npx json-server --watch db.json --port 5000
   ```

   This will start the mock API at `http://localhost:5000`.

4. **Start the React app**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The app will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.
   
## ðŸ’¡ Notes

* This project is **for learning purposes only**
* You can modify `db.json` to change the mock API data

If you want, I can also make a **more polished version** with badges, screenshots, and step-by-step examples of API calls. That would make it look more professional on GitHub.

Do you want me to make that upgraded README?
